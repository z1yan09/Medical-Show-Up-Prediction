<h1>Movie Recommendation Project</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
This project is a comprehensive movie recommendation system that utilizes multiple tools and techniques to provide accurate and personalized movie recommendations. The system employs SQL for database management, Excel for data manipulation, and Jupyter Notebook for Python programming. It implements three types of filtering methods: content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and hybrid filtering, along with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to enhance the recommendation accuracy.<br>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
The goal of this project is to develop a robust movie recommendation system that can suggest movies to users based on their preferences and past interactions. The project integrates various filtering methods and NLP techniques to enhance the recommendation quality.<br>

<h3>Features</h3>
<b>Content-Based Filtering</b>: Recommends movies based on the similarity of movie attributes.<br>
<b>Collaborative Filtering:</b> Recommends movies based on user interaction data.<br>
<b>Hybrid Filtering:</b> Combines content-based and collaborative filtering to improve recommendations.<br>
<b>NLP Techniques:</b> Utilizes NLP for text processing and sentiment analysis.<br>
<h3>Data Sources</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Movies Data:</b> Contains information about movies such as title, genres, and other attributes.</li>
<li><b>Ratings Data:</b> Contains user ratings for different movies.</li>
<li><b>Users Data:</b> Contains information about users.</li>
</ul>
Techniques Used
SQL: For database management and querying.
Excel: For data manipulation and analysis.
Python (Jupyter Notebook): For implementing the recommendation algorithms.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on attributes like genre, director, etc.
Collaborative Filtering: Uses user interaction data to find similarities between users or items.
Hybrid Filtering: Combines both content-based and collaborative filtering.
NLP Techniques: For text processing, feature extraction, and sentiment analysis.
